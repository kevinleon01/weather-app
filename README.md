### About

A simple weather application that pulls up current data for three cities: Houston, New York, Buenos Aires. It pulls information from the openweather api and displays it using React, Redux, Typescript, and Javascript.


### Project Status

App should work indefinietly since there's no custom domain or hosting expense to keep up with. API allots suffieicnet calls on a per/month basis. 


### Reflection

- one week solo project
- set out to build a simple weather app that displays the current weather info for a few cities
- project served as a learning experience for a more complete react app

-Unexepected Issues

While this app took more effort to build than initially expected, it was a good introduction and excerice in both typescript and tailwindcss.
